            <p>While creating characters is one of the few parts of a TTRPG that can be done on your own, I often found myself needing some kind of staring point to push myself beyond the basics (how many Human fighters can you play?).
                Paizo's prodcuts have an amazing breadth and depth of possibilities, and it's easy to miss some options. If you have any suggestions or comments, please <a hef="mailto:tom.larsen@hey.com">get in touch!</a>
